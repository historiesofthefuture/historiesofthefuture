Animacy and mortality usually go together. We think of both as
attributes of ‘life.’ Mortality is the condition by which life is
susceptible to death, while animacy is the semantic or linguistic coding
of liveliness or sentience. Both features help us define ‘life itself.’
But [paranimates](http://histscifi.com/essays/mukharji/paranimate.html)
frequently and variously decouple ‘mortality’ and ‘animacy.’ Immortal
beings for instance, are animate without being mortal. Re-animated
beings by contrast remain mortal whilst lacking most characteristic
forms of animacy such as liveliness, sentience, gestural autonomy etc.
Paranimates therefore defamiliarize our notion of life and force us to
rethink exactly *what* is life.

In this essay, I focus on one such prominent attempt to reimagine *life*
through paranimates*.* Though I call it a single attempt, it involved
multiple actors and texts. At its core were two SF novels written
respectively in 1909 and 1910 by Dinendrakumar Ray (1869-1943). Ray is
usually remembered as one of the pioneers of Bengali detective fiction
in the 1890s and indeed the vast majority of his novels were in fact
detective fiction, but he also authored a few books in other genres,
such as biography (including one of Napoleon) and at least two SF
novels.

*Jal Mohanta* \[The False Abbot\], the first of the two, tells the story
of a Bengali adventurer, Nalini Karfarma, who is befriended and employed
by a brilliant but ruthless Japanese doctor, Akuma (a tribute to the
Japanese politician, [Count
Okuma](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426606/Okuma-Shigenobu)
perhaps?). The two travel through China into the heart of Tibet in
search of a secret kept in a remote and ancient monastery. The abbots of
the monastery have, we learn, for centuries hidden from the world
knowledge of a strange and mysterious force or energy that could be used
to heal the diseased and raise the dead. The novel gets its name from
the fact that Akuma poses as one of the high abbots with a view to
stealing the mysterious knowledge.

Throughout the novel animacy and mortality are juxtaposed with each
other in myriad distinctive ways. In one short chapter where the old
abbots of the monastery demonstrate their ability to ‘bridge the gap
between life and death,’ we are shown three concrete examples where
animacy and mortality are distinctively configured.

In the first instance, a man who is completely paralyzed and unable to
speak, move, eat, or drink is miraculously revived by the used of a
mysterious ointment and fumigation. The man, though on the brink of
death, is clearly not dead, yet he has lost most of his powers of
animation. Upon his re-animation, he does not become immortal but simply
regains his powers of movement.

In the second instance, a man who has died a few hours earlier and is
patently dead is re-animated. In this case that agent of [re-animation
is a massive manually operated galvanic
battery](https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/leonardo/v048/48.3.stephens.pdf).
This man, once re-animated, is capable of movement and obedience to
commands but does not seem to be possessed of a will and falls back dead
the moment the abbots stop the machine.

Finally, in the third instance, those who have long died and whose
bodies are no longer available are brought back to life. The abbots
create a smoke screen by throwing some special dried leaves into a fire
while uttering esoteric *mantras* and the dead appear upon the smoke
screen like images in a silent movie*.* There is no sound, but the
images look real and move around freely upon the screen.

The three instances clearly instantiate what Mel Chen has recently
called an [‘animacy hierarchy.’](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Animacies/)
But whereas the animacy hierarchy appears to be graduated and
continuous, mortality seems to provide a threshold that must be bridged.
‘Life’ takes different forms depending on where and how the animacy
hierarchy intersects with the threshold of mortality. Surely, the long
dead saints who appear on the smoke screen have some form of ‘life’
though they lack both a body and a voice. Similarly the re-animated
corpse, too, has some form of ‘life’ imparted to it by the galvanic
battery. But it is obvious that the two forms of ‘life’ are not
identical.

Dinendrakumar Ray developed this theme of non-identical forms of ‘life’
further the following year in another novel titled, *Pisach Purohit*
\[Undead Priest\]. Set mostly in London, Ray here tells the story of a
young Bengali gentleman, Narendra Sen, whose father had been employed in
colonial Egypt for a long time. Upon the sudden death of the father, the
son inherited an ancient Egyptian mummy. Predictably, in fulfilment of
Victorian and Edwardian anxieties about the [mummy’s
curse](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2867/unwrapping-the-mummys-curse),
the mummy came to life in London. It turned out that the mummy was an
ancient Egyptian high priest, Ra-Tai, who had sworn to wreak terrible
vengeance upon the civilization that desecrated his grave and occupied
his country. Ra-Tai was not only able to control other people’s thoughts
and actions by his special powers, but he was even able to unleash
terrible epidemics upon entire cities and nations.

In an attempt to wreak double vengeance upon both imperial Britain and
Narendra Sen, who had spurned Ra-Tai’s attempts at collaboration, the
ancient priest ‘vaccinated’ Sen with plague germs. The ‘vaccine’
rendered Sen himself immune to the plague but turned him into a
transmitter of plague. His mere presence in a city or nation
contaminated the air with plague germs and devastated his surroundings.
He had no way of controlling the contagion that spread from him. In
Ra-Tai, Sen and their hapless neighbours, not to mention the plague
germs, we find once again distinctly different forms of life. But
whereas in *Jal Mohanta* the parallel forms of life are merely
distinctive from each other, in *Pisach Purohit* some of the life-forms
are mutually antagonistic. Thus the plague germs and Sen himself were
antagonistic or threatening to the life of their neighbours. In the
finale to *Pisach Purohit* Sen goes into self-imposed exile in order to
prevent further deaths. In the latter novel then, paranimacy becomes
socialized. Instead of the tableau-style heterogeneity presented in *Jal
Mohanta*, in *Pisach Purohit* we are forced to confront the always
already socialized nature of parallel forms of animacy. Animacy exists
in relation to other forms of animacy and sometimes these can be
antithetical.

Interestingly, the conclusion of the novel suggests that antithetical
forms of animacy may also engender moral choices about the degree of
socialization. The self-chosen exile of Sen suggests that animacy and
intimacy needs to be brought into conversation. Certain forms of animacy
might engender a moral argument against intimacy.

Sen’s predicament calls to mind that of [Typhoid
Mary](http://io9.com/what-the-city-of-new-york-did-to-typhoid-mary-was-pre-1674812001)
in the New York area. Mary Mallone, an Irish immigrant and the first
known asymptomatic carrier of typhoid, was forcibly quarantined for the
first time from 1907 to 1910. Later, in 1915, she would be permanently
quarantined and eventually die in prison. In her case, as in Sen’s, we
come face to face with the homogeneity of life that underwrites
biopolitical regimes. The biopolitical commitment to prolong life and
make it more productive assumes a certain coherence and uniformity to
life itself. It eschews the possibility that life can come in various
forms and sometimes the sustenance of one form of life might directly be
antithetical to another form of life. These [toxic
animacies](http://glq.dukejournals.org/content/17/2-3/265.abstract)
undermine the moral consensus that biopolitical regimes seek to build
and expose the necessary violence through which certain forms of life
are preferentially protected. The difference between Typhoid Mary’s
predicament and that of Sen’s is that whilst the former is de-socialized
through incarceration, the latter embraces de-socialization as a morally
informed choice. The choice seems to be between the government’s right
to control certain forms of animacy to protect others and paranimate
beings being morally responsible for the degrees of social intimacy they
enjoy.

The protection, sustenance and development of life, instead of being a
settled universal desideratum awaiting executive implementation through
enlightened government policy, became a complex moral and political
problem. Consequently, the ‘sciences’ through which paranimate life was
protected and sustained were not simply rational bodies of biological
knowledge. They were also moral codes. It was this
[biomoral](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2943361?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
aspect of paranimate sciences that required Ray’s scientists to
simultaneously be priests. Whether they were abbots in a Shangri
La-esque Tibetan monastery or the eponymous Egyptian high-priest, they
embodied a romantic identity of priest-scientists.

Ray’s paranimate science did not just remain an ideal. It received
practical elaboration in the copious writings of his student [Aurobindo
Ghose](http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/index.php)
(1872-1950). Ghose is today revered as one of the most charismatic and
influential Hindu mystics of the twentieth century. Raised in England by
a Christian minister, when Ghose returned to India in 1898 he did not
know any Indian languages and sought a good Bengali tutor. Ray was
already a minor figure in the Bengali literary scene at the time but
unhappy with his day job as a court clerk and therefore in search for a
more fulfilling employment. Through a series of happy connections, Ray
became Ghose’s Bengali tutor and remained with Ghose, living at his
residence, for nearly two years and developing a close relationship with
him. Later Ghose briefly rose to fame as the leader of an underground
group of anti-colonial ‘terrorists.’ But while in jail, Ghose underwent
a spiritual awakening and thereafter retired to a retreat in the French
colony of Pondicherry. There, with a growing number of disciples from
across world, Sri Aurobindo, as he came to be called, wrote extensively
about a new synthesis of science, spirituality and morality that he
called ‘Supramental Yoga’ or ‘Integral Yoga.’ This new synthesis
involved both the rethinking of ‘life’ and the ‘science’ suitable for
knowledge of such ‘life’. Of ‘life’ Aurobindo wrote, offering a poetic
interpretation of the works of his teacher:


> Life, death, — death, life; the words have led for ages
> Our thought and consciousness and firmly seemed
> Two opposites; but now long-hidden pages
> Are opened, liberating truths undreamed.
> Life only is, or death is life disguised, —
> Life a short death until by life we are surprised

> This more capacious notion of life, despite being strung together by a
> shared spirit, included within it a bewildering diversity of forms.

> I saw my soul a traveller through Time;
> From life to life the cosmic ways it trod,
> Obscure in the depths and on the heights sublime,
> Evolving from the worm into the god.

> ‘Science’ as we knew it, according to Aurobindo could not fathom this
> more capacious and diversified notion of ‘life’.

> This was the secret Science could not see;
> Aware of death, to life her eyes were blind.

> …

> The organ for the thing itself she takes,
> The brain for mind, the body for the soul,
> Nor has she patience to explore the whole,
> But like a child a hasty period makes.

> In a poem titled *A Vision of Science* Aurobindo insinuated a new,
> future ‘science’ which would transcend the divide between ‘science’ and
> ‘religion’ and be able to make manifest a more fulsome picture of the
> enspirited cosmos:

> I dreamed that in myself the world I saw,
> Wherein three Angels strove for mastery

> …

> Science was one, the other gave her name, Religion.
> But a third behind them came,
> Veiled, vague, remote, and had as yet no right
> Upon the world, but lived in her own light.

> Paranimate science was the wisdom of the Third Angel.
