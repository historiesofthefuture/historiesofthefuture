2064: The eve of the 50th anniversary of the Ferguson Uprising. The
struggle has matured and reshaped every facet of social life. But
forgetfulness is endemic, so the Risers, now in their seventies, are
looking to pump energy in to the movement. Among the new initiatives
designed by the People’s Science Council in the aftermath of Bloody
November, is a bioReparations programme that allows victims of police
brutality to regenerate organs or limbs via stem cell transplantation.
Over twenty thousand individuals have benefited from such procedures.
Now a major new component of the programme will be unveiled for the
anniversary, simply called the reGeneration. But the largest biobank in
the country has been repeatedly hit by raiders intent on sabotaging the
programme and selling stem cells on the white market. Aiyana Jones and
her team of Keepers have to find a way to secure the cell depository and
revitalize the movement.

**reGeneration (2064)**

*Whoever said time heals*  
*Never had a tumor*  
*Growing inside their belly*  
*Mistaken for a child*.  

Aiyana read these words, faded on the inside flap of the reGeneration
flyer. She had been sleeping with it under her pillow for the last month
and the moisture must have rubbed some of the ink off. And as many times
as she read it, it was no less disturbing. The thought of growing one’s
own demise. *What hope, or delusion, or mix of both leads one to ignore
the lack of movement?*

With one arm folded under her pillow, her thumb and forefinger rubbed
the paper back and forth to the rhythm of ticks on her hypno-bit. Just
as her fingers grew limp on the flyer and her thoughts drifted, “time is
a festering, when what ails us is left to blossom”…the alarm screeched
across her forehead. Not her hypno-bit, which would have been a silent
buzz on her wrist. It was a bank alarm, the third one this week.

Aiyana sat up abruptly, swinging her legs out of bed and lifting herself
into the chair in a single motion. Although she would reach the biobank
first because most of the keepers were confined to their legs, she was
also responsible for the widest perimeter. She tapped her hypno-bit
twice to stop the sleep app, and reached across the bed for her coat and
scarf. In the time it took to bundle up, she reached the foyer, headed
out the door, and towards the bank.

<div class="center"> … 
</div>

After thwarting yet another break-in, the keepers were exhausted. They
had checked the vast perimeter of the Martin Cell Depository, seeing to
it that each and every cryotank was secure, and they sat in the atrium
awaiting Aiyana’s return.

By now they were all accustomed to the silent screech of the biobank
alarm, which only they could hear. Even so, the grinding migraines were
not easy to shake. The atrium was, at turns, thumping, humming, buzzing,
as the alarm resin ricocheted inside their heads.

Soon enough Aiyana returned with footage from the bank’s Eye. But as
they searched for clues, it wasn’t clear how the raiders managed to
cross the perimeter this time. The Keeper feed from \#StemCellsMatter
was no more helpful. Raiders had long found a way to distort the
geotracking function so telling the difference between posts from actual
keepers versus posers was nearly impossible. There was a group working
on a real time authentication app to make the feed more useful, but as
of now, the programmers couldn’t keep up with the code jammers.

Raiders’ desperation to stifle the 50th reGeneration was mounting. And
it was getting harder and harder for Aiyana’s team to predict what new
scheme they would employ. She still wasn’t sure why the weevil drones
they used last week malfunctioned before reaching the main cryolab.
Something beyond the elaborate security matrix seemed to be sabotaging
the break-ins. As she exchanged theories with the others, running
through a mental checklist of all the structural vulnerabilities that
could have been compromised, the bank keeper burst in to the atrium,
nearly breathless.

Aiyana reassured her that everything had been reinforced. None of the
cryotanks had been touched. All of the cell lines had been accounted
for, including the lines needed for the risky procedure scheduled for
later that week. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Ferguson Uprising,
the People’s Science Council had been working around the clock to revive
one Mr. Eric Garner, the father of six who was choked to death by NYPD
officers in 2014.

Holding him in cryosleep until all the necessary techniques had been
honed, the Council was confident Garner could be resuscitated without
incident. His last words, “I can’t breathe”, had served as a clarion
call for five decades of movement building. How fitting that he would
attend the 50th reGeneration in person. If, that is, the multiple stem
cell transplants were successful. A lot could go wrong. Infections.
Graft Failure. Cancers. If it worked, he would be the first adult to
successfully undergo resuscitation *and* transplantation. Only children
had survived after more than a month of cryosuspension.

The bioReparations programme, now in its tenth year, allowed victims of
police brutality to regenerate organs and limbs using induced
pluripotent stem cells. Researchers had honed the technique, taking a
skin cell and coaxing it back to the stage of “pluripotency” where it
could then be turned in to any other kind of cell in the human body.
Because the transplanted tissue was produced using a person’s own cells,
many of the complications that came from donor cells were avoided. Over
twenty thousand individuals had undergone this suite of procedures… and
nearly all survived.

Even so, producing a viable stem cell line takes time. And most patients
could not survive on life support long enough to undergo
transplantation.

<div class="center">\*\*\*
</div>

In the early days, when the bioReparations programme was just an idea,
many people actually started banking their own skin cells—a kind of
insurance policy. That was before police forces had officially been
disbanded and the keeper network was developed.

Those were the days of “every 28 hours”—children playing cops and
robbers shot down on playgrounds, teenagers goofing off with toy guns in
departments stores left bleeding in the aisles, mentally ill adults
treated with multiple shots to the head, mowed down for walking,
driving, breathing out of place. Suspects’ phones, wallets, and other
objects mistaken for weapons, police reaching for firearms instead of
non-lethal options, and recordings rarely leading to indictment.

Not to mention all the residual violence—bystanders dying of shock or
heart failure, onlookers waking up in night terrors for years afterward,
the chronic stress of living under siege, getting under the skin.
Cellular memory, Social amnesia.

Harnessing our history, transforming the biopolity! Come in for a free
consultation to see if *Middle Passage Mitochondria* is right for you.”

By the time the public health establishment accepted it as the root
cause of heart disease, hypertension, and other epidemics, everyday
violence was at an all time high. No way to ignore it. But the
epigenetics industry that had, by then, taken the world by storm
wouldn’t let go so easily. The Human Genome Super PAC successfully
lobbied for an ObamaCare amendment, establishing mandatory gene-testing
stations to be built alongside all health clinics. To even be seen by a
healthcare worker you had to get your genome mapped. All the latest
drugs were tailored to specific haplogroups. So if you didn’t know
yours, forget about being treated. And if you couldn’t afford a test,
you were just out of luck.

We are still trying to figure out what to do with all those abandoned
testing stations.

The Keeper News exposé on “genome map forgeries” was the breaking point.
The fact that people were buying knock-off maps just to get access to
treatments defeated the whole point of tailored medicine. Even so, it
took another decade to fully establish the People’s Science Council and
begin addressing the source of so much sickness. The chronic stress of
living under siege.

After uniformed officers were forced to wear body cams in 2015, the
non-indictments flowed even more freely. They were, after all,
responding as they had been trained. “It’s not meant to be a fair
fight.” “Non-lethal responses are not in our repertoire.” To indict the
officers would be to admit that the entire apparatus was defective.

The number of people who had been disabled from gunshots wounds, whether
due to police aggression, gang violence, or other altercations, created
a boon for the biobanking sector. Almost everyone knew at least one
person who had deposited cells.

Only certified victims of police violence were covered under the
Reparations Act of 2025, but anyone was eligible for a transplant if
they could pay. Slowly replacing the college fund common in the early
part of the century, parents and grandparents who could afford to do so,
opened a tissue account for their loved ones. “Don’t cell your family
short! Bank with us today”, read the floating billboards. Although most
of the procedures were far too expensive for the average person, the
monthly payment to keep a cell line alive was manageable.

Aiyana Mo’Nay Stanley Jones, killed by a Detroit SWAT Team in 2010, was
the only person who survived cryosleep and transplants without any
significant side effects.

But she was a child at the time, 7 years old when an officer threw a
flash grenade where she lay sleeping on her living room couch, and then
shot her as a reality TV crew filmed the raid.

When the Council woke Aiyana up and implanted the new heart, lungs, and
spine, at first there was only a minor graft rejection, which transplant
specialists were able to control. But then came the seizures. The
blackouts. And hallucinations.

With a grant from the Humanity+ Foundation, Aiyana’s transplant team
designed the first of its kind Chairperson™—an apparatus that not only
maintains internal homeostasis so she no longer experiences the original
side effects of organ transplantation. It also includes a number of
augmentations: the ability to hover up to 40mph on land or water. And an
acute sensitivity to electrical fields, which enhances her ability to
communicate, orientate to her surroundings, track things, and protect
herself. The gold standard in second life starter kits!

Garner, on the other hand, was not only going to be the first adult, but
one who required multiple regenerated organs a half-century after his
first life was prematurely taken. Waking up would only be the beginning…

**Postscript**

This is an experiment in using fiction to know things differently. A
space to think anew about the themes of my research—innovation,
inequity, biotechnology, and racial justice among them. I am guided in
this endeavor by three recent experiences.

The first was re-reading W. E. B. Du Bois’s short story, *The Comet*
(1920). Set in a dystopian world where the racial status quo is
momentarily overturned, it underscores the importance of storytelling in
scholarly and civic praxis. The direct link he crafted between sociology
and speculative fiction reminded me that we need these windows into
alternative realities, even if it is just a glimpse, to challenge
ever-present narratives of inevitability as it relates to both
technology and society. Stories remind us that the beginning, middle,
and the end could all be otherwise.

The second experience that led me to substitute story for essay was
listening to writer Ursula Le Guin’s National Book Foundation acceptance
speech: “I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the
voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can
see through our fear- stricken society and its obsessive technologies to
other ways of being, and even imagine some real grounds for hope. We
will need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries — the
realists of a larger reality.” *Here, here,* whispered the young poet I
long ago wrapped in layers of scholarly silk awaiting the Academic
Afterlife. Her first words upon stepping out of the Tomb of the Learned:
*Facts, alone, will not save us.*

Finally, the third experience was completing my book *People’s Science:
Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier*. Towards the end of the
revision process, and buried on page 172, I was finally able to
articulate what I now see as the heart of the project: “But somehow
imaginations go limp when we are confronted with social dis-order. For
many people, the idea that we can defy politics as usual and channel
human ingenuity toward more cooperative and inclusive forms of social
organization is utterly far-fetched. Thus I am convinced that any
institutional retooling must begin by first querying this faith in
biological regeneration alongside our underdeveloped belief in social
transformation. *If our bodies can regenerate, why do we perceive our
body politic as so utterly fixed*?”[^1] This story is an attempt to
perceive otherwise, to hold myself accountable to the query I buried in
*People’s Science*, to formulate a critique at the power/knowledge nexus
through narrative, and ultimately to *fetch* a different social vision
that, even to the author of this tale, feels incredibly far off.

With these provocations, then, I take the idea of a sociological
imagination quite literally, and envisage a not-too-distant future where
race, science, and subjectivity are reconfigured differently, defiantly,
and hope-fully.
