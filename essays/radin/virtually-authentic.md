In June of 2015 *Jurassic World*, the fourth installment of the movie
franchise begun in 1993 with [*Jurassic
Park*](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jurassic_park_(film)) (the novel was
published in 1990), broke [the
record](variety.com/2015/film/news/jurassic-world-box-office-record-avengers-1201519679)
for biggest opening weekend in box office history.

During the weeks leading up to the official opening, an exquisitely
sophisticated marketing apparatus pumped hype through the arteries of
major cities around the world. I witnessed this first hand. In Tel Aviv,
the film was advertised on a billboard as large as *Indomitus rex*—the
monstrous hybrid that wrecks havoc on the rebuilt Jurassic World theme
park. In train stations in Berlin and Paris, announcements that the
dinosaurs had arrived were posted along side updates of train times
announcing, “The Park is Now Open.”

With *Jurassic World*—and its marketing campaign—we learn that the
ability to stand beside our no-longer extinct brethren may be the most
banal element of what technoscience is up to. People have become
jaded—[a hyper-realistic website prominently indicates where visitors
can get churros in between feedings](http://www.jurassicworld.com)—which
justifies the attempt to engineer spectacularly horrifying creatures.
*Indomitus rex* is meant to be to *Tyrannosaurus rex* as Godzilla is to
a pet iguana. (However, spoiler alert: In the final scenes of the movie
*T. Rex* ultimately triumphs with help from “Blue,” a well-trained
*Velociraptor*).

Months earlier, a slick [three-minute promotional
clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxigP1as9SI) attributed to InGen,
the fictional corporation behind the disasters that took place on the
Costa Rican island, Isla Nublar in *Jurassic Park,* made the rounds on
social media. I worked in media relations before returning to academia
and such a clip would be part of any savvy public relations
rehabilitation strategy. In it, a new generation of employees donned
crisp white lab coats as they spoke directly to the camera and explained
how today’s science had resolved and redefined the problems of the past.
InGen sought to rebrand itself as placing the world at humanity’s
fingertips, “deepening our connection to the natural world,” and
allowing us to design life for purposes that include health,
communication, and defense. As one of InGen’s new generation of hotshots
put it, “There’s literally no limit to what we can learn from these
creatures.”

In 2015, InGen’s corporate slogan declared, “Tomorrow. Today.” It was
persuasive. I was tempted to believe in the reality of InGen and its
vision. I could even take up virtual (if unpaid) employment.

The viral campaign did not stop there. Not only were the potential
unintended consequences of the virtual laboratory addressed and
summarily dismissed, a website appeared for the multi-national
corporation responsible for its financial revivification. Multiple short
films appeared on [www.masraniglobal.com](http://www.masraniglobal.com),
produced to persuade shareholders that their investment decisions were
sound. The cool blue tones of the website betrayed very little, if any,
connection to the Jurassic World theme park or movie, instead drawing on
now generic conventions of corporate branding, including an emphasis on
“vision, innovation, and success.” A “live” stock ticker—charting the
real time flows of capital—completed the illusion. (After the film
premiered, an “[urgent
memo](http://www.masraniglobal.com/investors/index.html)” from
headquarters appeared on this page, indicating that “due to unforeseen
circumstances at Jurassic World, resulting in the worst financial crisis
the company has ever seen, Masrani Global Corporation will be holding an
emergency meeting to discuss the future of the company and its various
subsidiaries.”)

In these ways, the marketing of *Jurassic World* was as much a part of
the spectacle, of the experience, as the movie that ostensibly justified
its creation. This kind of assemblage is known as “media mix,” which, in
recent years, has become a key strategy deployed by movie studios for
deepening the immersive experience.[^1] (It’s also a strategy for making
sense of the multimedia enterprise that accompanied Bruno Latour’s [*An
Inquiry into the Modes of Existence*](http://www.modesofexistence.org),
a project that asked, “how do we compose a common world?”)

Together, the movie and the advertising apparatus advance the conceit
that our planet has become a giant theme park, Jurassic World. Does it
matter whether or not the laboratories and corporations are real?
Whether we can *actually* visit the theme park or merely know the ways
in which it is possible to exist? Can this kind of simulacra—the
immersive experience that is meant to stand in for but not be
reality—create a space in which nonscientists are invited to speculate
what else can be produced by science? The virtual representation life
augmented by science, its fictive reality, thus becomes a source of its
critique.

This kind of place—the space of immersive, authentic recreation as well
as its commodification—was a central preoccupation of Michael Crichton,
author of the best-selling series of novels on which the movie franchise
is based. Long before he wrote about dinosaurs, he explored theme of the
amusement park in his 1973 film
[*Westworld*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHodSSB_YpM) (it was never
published as a book). It features a vacation destination comprised of
three historically specific worlds, the American Wild West (cowboys),
the Middle Ages (knights), and ancient Rome (gladiators). Upper middle
class people could visit as they would any all-inclusive resort. Each
world was populated by androids capable of having sex and being
killed—this seems to be the full range of their human skill set—for the
sake of placating the visitor’s id. The conceit remains potent enough to
justify a
[remake](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/23/jonathan-nolan-westworld)
currently underway at HBO.

A theme park was also at the core of Crichton’s 1999 novel,
[*Timeline*](http://www.michaelcrichton.com/timeline/), which required
travel to 14^th^ century Europe. In this novel, which was subsequently
made into a movie and a video game, a brilliant but amoral
physicist-cum-entrepreneur builds a time machine. With it people can
visit the past as they would an amusement park. Of course, things go
horribly wrong. But before they do the cynical impresario reveals his
prescience:

> "*Authenticity *will be the buzzword of the twenty-first century. And
> what is authentic? Anything that is not devised and structured to make
> a profit. Anything that is not controlled by corporations. Anything
> that exists for its own sake, that assumes its own shape. But of
> course, nothing in the modern world is allowed to assume its own
> shape. The modern world is the corporate equivalent of a formal
> garden, where everything is planted and arranged for effect. Where
> nothing is untouched, where nothing is authentic. Where then will
> people turn for the rare and desirable experience of authenticity?
>  They will turn to the past . . . .The past is real. It's authentic.
>  *And this will make the past unbelievably attractive.* That's why I
> say that the future is the past." (Italics his, p. 401)

*Timeline* relied upon a mix of science and business to bring the
present to the past, in ways that resonate with how *Jurassic Park*
brought the past to the present, and *Jurassic World* promises to bring
the future to the present, with InGen’s slogan, “Tomorrow, Today.”

When *Jurassic Park* was made into a movie in 1993—before [Craig Venter
founded Celera](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068906/) to
overtake the federally funded Human Genome Project—Crichton’s coupling
of science and capitalism was interpreted as an indictment of science
more generally. The *New York Times* ran a long opinion piece titled,
“Evil Science Runs Amok—Again,” in which the author, a Professor of
English at the University of Southern California, criticized the
portrayal of science and scientists.[^2] Carol Dukes wrote, “To the
creators of ‘Jurassic Park,’ technological advance is virtually a no-win
. . . With this attitude on the part of the purveyors of popular
culture, how can we expect to attract young students to science, a field
they are snubbing in droves?”

What Dukes could not have known in advance was that her text would be
wrapped around an advertisement for Mobil, formatted like a short
article. “Cradle science” featured a cartoon of an infant in her crib
engrossed by a computer screen (“by the year 2000,” the ad emphasizes,
“60 percept of our workforce will be women, immigrants and people of
color”). “At Mobil,” the reader was informed, “we’re helping students
learn to analyze by providing learning materials to promote better
critical thinking at 24,000 high schools nationwide.” This juxtaposition
was ironic on multiple levels, not least of all the fact that
oil—Mobil’s source of wealth—is mined and processed from organic
material that has been stewing in the earth’s crust since the Jurassic
period.

In 1999 Crichton was asked to speak to the members of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) about the purported
tension between science and the media. This forum provided him with an
opportunity to address his detractors. It can be read as a response to
critiques of his depiction of science as well as a commentary on the
media context by which such critiques reach readers.

> “We live in a culture of relentless, round-the-clock boosterism for
> science and technology. With each new discovery and invention, the
> virtues are always oversold, the drawbacks understated. Who can forget
> the freely mobile society of the automobile, the friendly atom, the
> paperless office, the impending crisis of too much leisure time, or
> the era of universal education ushered in by television. We now hear
> the same utopian claims about the Internet. But everyone knows science
> and technology are inevitably a mixed blessing. How then will the
> fears, the concerns, the downside of technology be expressed? Because
> it has to appear somewhere. So it appears in movies, in stories—which
> I would argue is a good place for it to appear.”[^3]

In this light, Crichton’s depiction of science takes on a different
inflection. Rather than a luddite-like critic, he begins to resemble an
agent shaping the ways in which science can be subjected to critique and
potentially redeemed.

A century earlier, Arthur Conan Doyle or Edgar Allen Poe—two experts in
mixing literary cocktails of wonder and reason—created realist immersive
worlds that revealed glimmers of enchantment in the supposedly
disenchanted world inhabited by their readers. As Michael Saler has
argued of these writers, “fantasy helps us accept that the real world is
to some degree imaginary, relying on contingent narratives that are
subject to challenge and change.”[^4] Crichton’s theme parks do the
same—they present us with the problems and possibilities that animate
our obsession with authenticity.

Michael Crichton receives a creative credit in *Jurassic World*, but he
played little if any role in the writing or production of the film,
given that he died in 2008. However, the spirit of his fiction—which
serves as a means for posing new kinds of questions about science,
technology, and capitalism—is most alive in the marketing campaign. It’s
there that the fictive reality and values of the scientific life are
rendered most sharply: a world in which scientists become spokespeople
and businessmen become benefactors and we take pleasure, comfort, and
health from the byproducts. Our world is *Jurassic World,* and its
boundaries stretch far beyond the cinema.
