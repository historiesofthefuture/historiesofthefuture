James Bedford’s words – “I’m feeling better” – would have been funny,
Monty Python-esque even, had they not been the last utterance of a dying
man. On 12 January 1967, the retired psychology professor in Glendale,
California passed way. Or, as advocates of cryonics would later phrase
it, Bedford “deanimated.”

Major newspapers from coast to coast described the “eerie commotion”
that accompanied Bedford’s passing in morbid detail.[^1] After he was
pronounced dead, an anti-coagulant drug was injected into him while a
mechanical heart maintained blood flow. Other chemicals followed. After
six hours, his body, now wrapped in aluminum foil, was placed
in dry ice before members of the Cryonics Society of California
transferred it to a “cryo-capsule” – a giant dewar filled with liquid
nitrogen fabricated by a Phoenix-based wig-maker – for transfer to
storage center in Arizona.

Doctors at UCLA branded the experiment “absurd” but, not surprisingly,
it received wide press coverage. Advocates claimed, given cryonics’
potential benefits, that that academic scientists should at least
investigate before dismissing the idea.[^2] Science fiction
writer-futurist – a “blue skyer” according to the *New York Times* –
Frederick Pohl told a group of insurance industry executives that they
should prepare for the “\$30 trillion market of the future” and write
policies to cover cryonic suspension.”[^3]

Fiction writers had already engaged with cryonics for decades. Edgar
Allen Poe and Jack London both wrote stories featuring cold-induced
immortality before 1900. It remained a durable theme in magazines
published by Hugo Gernsback before World War Two. After 1945, ideas for
cryonic suspension were discussed seriously by reputable scientists at
established institutions, often with some sort of connection to space
exploration or technological utopianism in general. For example, in 1960
two medical scientists discussed the possibility of lowering a person’s
metabolic rate in order to permit long-term space travel, coining the
word “cyborg” at the same time. Throughout the 1960s, books and articles
about life extension via freezing appeared, the best known one being
Robert Ettinger’s *The Prospect of Immortality* (1964). In 1966,
Columbia University physicist Gerald Feinberg discussed the science of
life prolongation in the widely read magazine *Physics Today*.[^4] While
these helped bring cryonics to a wider audience, mainstream scientific
publications, not surprisingly, remained chilly to the idea.[^5]

Nonetheless, 1967 stands as the tipping point for public awareness of
cryonics. News coverage of the fledgling cryonics movement situated it
the idea somewhere between, hubristic, hopeful, and humorous. If the
average person had missed coverage of James Bedford’s suspension, they
might seen a variation of the idea a month later on national television.
On 16 February 1967, CBS broadcast the *Star Trek* episode called “Space
Seed.” It wove a series of themes – extended human space travel, life
extension via cryogenic suspension, and personal improvement via genetic
modification – that would become standard motifs for the transhumanist
movement a few decades later.

In “Space Seed,” the crew of the Enterprise encounter Khan Noonien
Singh, a genetically superior yet morally deficient tyrant who, after
the “Eugenics Wars” of the 1990s had been cryogenically suspended and
exiled into deep space.[^6] Some 13 million Americans watched Capt. Kirk
and his crew awaken Khan from his cold-induced sleep. After reviving,
Khan, aided by a sympathetic, smitten historian, fights to take over the
*Enterprise*. After failing to win control, Kirk banishes Khan again,
this time to an abandoned planet. Khan accepts his fate, seeing it as a
both a challenge and chance to tame a new world. The superhuman Khan
would go on to become a popular and profit-generating character for the
*Star Trek* franchise into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

After the publicity following Bedford’s cryonic suspension, new
organizations sprang up to support the small but growing cryonics
community. To help make their case, advocates of cryonics cited major
advances in medicine and technology – space exploration and nascent
genetic engineering were often given as evidence – that had occurred
throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. To them, this was evidence that future
technologies would surely offer some means to revive them from their
preserved state.[^7] A typical arguments advocates deployed followed a
logic reminiscent of Pascal’s Wager, stating that the benefits of
signing up for cryonics, even if the likelihood of revival was small,
far out-weighed the costs. As one organization phrases it – “Would you
rather be in the experimental group or the control group?”[^8]

Membership was especially active in the Los Angeles and Silicon Valley
areas where people, perhaps more than other regions, had a passion for
technology, seen literally as their potential savior, and an unabashed
faith in the future. In 1969, the Cryonics Society of California, for
example, claimed 500 members and announced plans to build a “long-term
depository” in Barstow.[^9] Fred Chamberlain, an employee at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, started a company called Manrise in La Canada
with his partner Linda. In 1972, they self-published one of the first
manuals for cryo-preservation.[^10] The Chamberlains went on to form the
Alcor Society for Solid State Hypothermia which became the world’s
largest cryonics organization.[^11] Art imitated life a few years later
and humor trumped horror when Woody Allen used cryonics to set up the
plot of his goofy comic film *Sleeper* (1973).

It is easy to see how cryonics, as I’ll take up in a later essay, rests
in an overlapping space between science fiction and certain kind of
speculative research, seeking but denied mainstream scientific
respectability. More intriguing is the way in which cryonics intersects
with people’s perceptions of the future.

First, it is important to recognize that the hundreds of people who have
signed up for cryonics believe fervently in the future. For them,
spending years suspended in liquid nitrogen, awaiting a possible
reawakening is neither hilarious nor horrific. It is hopeful.
Cryonicists *believe* in a future where they will be healthy once again,
perhaps reunited with friends and family. Moreover, they imagine that
the intervening years between death and reanimation will be stable
enough, economically and socially, so as to maintain their suspension.
During this time, they believe advanced technologies will be developed
and perfected so as to enable their rejuvenation. The apogee of this
optimism is that, for cryonicists, the future is a temporal place where
they both wish to exist and where they will be accepted, wanted, and
perhaps loved.

Cryonics might appear to skeptics – and, to be fair, most mainstream
coverage of cryonics trends this way – as an outlier even in the “freak
show that is the boundless-optimism school of technological
forecasting.”[^12] A more historically accurate and empathetic reading,
however, can situate cryonics into a wider frame. We can, for example,
see it as part a long-standing secular belief, especially common among
Americans, in technological millennialism.[^13] By this, I mean the idea
that a new more perfect age waits and technology, not divinity, will
construct it. This new age will not, however, be available for all but
only open to those who have invested their faith and a little fortune.

What does the spike of interest in cryonics in the 1960s tell us about
the histories of science and medicine? For one thing, it reminds us to
reconsider that pervasive yet elusive term “context.” In the 1960s, as
researchers developed artificial organs and life support systems, the
definition of death was subject to reexamination.[^14] In 1968, a legal
dictionary defined death as “stoppage of the circulation of the blood,
and a cessation of the animal and vital functions consequent thereon,
such as respiration, pulsation, etc.” But this definition was already
under scrutiny by doctors, ethicists, and theologians.[^15] As death
became redefined less of an event and more as a process, optimists’
belief in the possibility of cryonics becomes more understandable. As
the *Los Angeles Times* reported in 1972, “The Future. Cryonics leaders
talk about it with a passion bordering on reverence. The future, they
say, belongs to science. The Golden Age of Biomedical Technology is at
hand. Are they wrong?”[^16]

But the emergence of cryonics c. 1967 can tell us something not just
about biomedical research and changing definitions of death *per se* but
also about *science* itself. The experimentation of the early
cryonicists reflects their belief that much remained to be discovered
about the natural world. Proponents for cryonics argued science’s own
history suggested that it would be more rational, over the long-term, to
believe that something – as long as no basic physical laws were being
violated – can be accomplished. In this telling, science means progress
and improvement, with advances coming that are both unexpected and full
of possibility. Coupled with this was a growing materialist philosophy
which held that a person’s intelligence and personality resided in the
physical structure of their brain.[^17] Preserve this and – like
extracting information from a failed hard drive – revival might be
possible.

Ultimately, cryonics connects to what Reinhart Koselleck called
“horizons of expectation.”[^18] Understanding the experience of people
experimenting with cryonics in 1967 becomes richer when we consider
their expectations for the future. Cryonicists, frozen in the present,
expected a future in which they might live again. The dilemma is that
the horizon always recedes as we approach it, a fine yet eternal line
separating present and future, actual and possible.

    long been a staple of space travel in sci-fi fiction and films.
    American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard even speculated on the
    possibility of “generation ships” that might carry people, their
    life functions suspended, far out into space. “It has long been
    known,” he wrote, “that protoplasm can remain inanimate for great
    periods of time, and can also withstand great cold, if in the
    granular state.” From “The Great Migration,” from p. 1611-1612 of

    years, or 10,000, and immortality is virtually certain.”
