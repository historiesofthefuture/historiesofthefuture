How does technoscience dream? How might technical practices that bring
into apprehension a world that is not yet here, and may never come to
pass, be thought of as a kind of technoscientific dreaming? Beyond
debates over whether artificial intelligence technologies or computers
have a consciousness within them, and hence perhaps a dream life, this
trilogy of essays considers how more prosaic social science
technoscientific practices make shared dreamscapes. In asking how
technoscience might dream, I want to think about the ways assemblies of
technical practices have generated not just facts but also speculative
phenomena that are a felt part of the world, even if intangible. How do
speculative social science practices produce a world where undecided
futures are brought into the present?

Speculation is a particular way of making futurity within the longer
history of ways of positing the future.[^1] Broadly, speculation is an
orientation of conjecture towards an uncertain horizon of expectation.
The term is used generously to gather together wide ranging practices
from a genre of fiction writing to high-stakes finance. One root of the
meaning of speculation is observation, and thus the term also evokes
ways of envisioning and bringing into awareness what is yet undecided.
Speculation, used in this way, names epistemic practices in which future
potentialities are summoned and become palpable in the present, whether
or not they ever come to pass.[^2]In financial speculation, a risky
future is betted on in order to beckon high rates of financial return.
In speculative fiction, a beyond to reality is conjured, often in ways
that generates ethical or political attachments to a realm of
possibility, of what could be. As a way of summoning future potentials
and apprehending the intangible, speculation is kin to practices of
imagination, fantasy, and dreaming. In this series of essays, I consider
speculation to be a kind of technoscientific dreaming. Moreover, in the
essays that follow I will give focus to this claim by tracking how girls
and women have been important figures of technoscientific dreaming in
twentieth century social science; their possible futures have been
attached to projects of rejuvenating the macro-phenomena of society, the
economy, populations, modernity, and nation-states. Entangled with
governmentalities, twentieth century social science practices have
helped to populate postcolonial dreamscapes with speculative futures for
women and girls.

Dreaming is an activity that exceeds both rationality and materiality
and yet is felt and consequential, and so I use dreaming here to think
about the shared imaginaries and horizons of expectation that
technoscientific practices populate the world with. As a kind of
dreaming, speculation gives form to the future, yet nonetheless still
involves an untethering from the present; it is a jump into the
intangible yet-to-be, could be, and the undecided, even if the
speculative practices themselves are rigorous methods of prediction,
calculation, and extrapolation with respected pedigrees. Speculation
tacks between intangibles, unknowns, and undecideds, on the one side,
and epistemic practices of writing, calculation, and modelling, on the
other. Within late twentieth century nation-states, technoscience
dreamscapes were composed of potent intangibles such as the
[macroeconomy](http://data.worldbank.org/) given to us by economic
models and the index of GDP, or [the web of social
relations](http://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/what-where-you-live-says-about-what-youll-buy-1813/)
that entangle us mapped by sociologists and marketers. Intangible and
speculative phenomena include forceful and significant forms such as
[population dynamics](http://www.census.gov/popclock/), [the national
economy](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/indicators), and
[consumer
confidence](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm),
each of which secures the cosmology that politicians, scientists,
academics, and lay people inhabit. Practices of calculating
probabilities, modelling, forecasting, and scenario building are all, at
least in part, examples of technoscientific dreaming performed by the
assemblies of instruments, practices, logics, and habits that make up
technoscience. While the history of science habitually emphasizes the
rationalizing, computational, and statistical dimensions of speculative
practices, in this trifecta of short essays I am interested in attending
to the work of feeling futures and apprehending intangibilities that
technoscience also accomplishes.

To think about a technoscience that dreams, it is helpful to turn to
Walter Benjamin, who, writing about the modernity of 19^th^ century
Paris, described the
[“phantasmagoria”](http://www.museudelcinema.cat/eng/colleccio_recursos.php?idreg=1396)
that commodity capitalism built into the materiality of shopping arcades
and consumer products.[^3]
[Phantasmagoria](http://www.museudelcinema.cat/eng/colleccio_recursos.php?idreg=1396)
was a form of European theatre in the late 18^th^ and 19^th^ centuries
that used a modified magic lantern to make projections of bizarre,
fabulous, and often frightening spectres. Phantasmagoria thus served as
a kind of “spectral technology” that projected imaginaries into the
world for viewers to join.[^4] Such projections were emotionally
charged, provoking collectively experienced affect, and stirring
audiences to question their senses and reality. For Benjamin, the modern
city produced its own mass phantasma—collective dreamscapes that
intoxicated urban life with the promissory potentials of an
industrialized world. One of the tasks of the historian, according to
Benjamin, was to attune to these collective phantasma and take notice of
the world as constituted by historically specific shared imaginaries
that were profoundly entangled with the concreteness of things.

In this spirit, speculation can be thought of as phantasma generating
practices that for the past hundred years have offered a potent mode for
orienting towards the future. While the phantasmagoria of the 19^th^
century theatre had been associated primarily with gothic and horror
performance, recent speculative phantasma are instead amorphous
politically and emotionally. Moreover, while the phantasmagoria of the
19^th^ century theatre were consciously created as illusions, I suggest
that the phantasma of technocientific dreaming are decidedly not
illusions, but rather constitutive of a world that includes felt and
potent intangibles, a world in which technoscience dreaming – the
generation and attachment to of a palpable yet-to-be – is core to so
many social science practices. When the future is at stake in so much
technoscience, then dreaming futures is one of its central activities.
Within technoscience, phantasma accompany quantification as another kind
of output, as the felt, aspirational, and consequential imaginaries that
structure the world in profound ways, as a potent aura in surfeit of
facticity.

The scholarly manifesto [*Speculate
This!*](http://speculatethis.pressbooks.com/) describes speculation as
“a pressing toward an apprehension of the unknown,” suggesting that
elusive futures can be felt and given form even if they are not fixed or
fully legible.[^5] The manifesto suggests that this pressing towards the
unknown can be divided into two different modes of conjuring future
possibility: “affirmative speculation,” which attempts to experiment
with and reopen the future against the hegemonic, as contrasted with
“firmative speculation” which narrows potentialities to then exploit and
foreclose them.[^6] For the manifesto, afrofuturism, speculative
fiction, and contemporary techno-art are generative arenas of
affirmative speculation. Good affirmative speculation opens imaginaries
and potentials for other worlds, while bad technoscientific and economic
speculation is “firmative” because it aims to fix possibilities so that
they might be gamed to benefit only the few. This binary of opening and
closing is an enticing framework for making sense of the politics of
speculation, even if most speculative practices neither obey such moral
neatness nor fit into an art versus science divide. What this
distinction suggests, however, is that speculative practices do not
merely amplify and expand uncertainty and possibility, but can by
contrast restrain and limit the scope of futurity. When technoscience
dreams futures, such dreams are not necessarily upturning of the
sedimented habits of knowledge making, even if dreaming might hold that
potential.

This chain of essays plays with the claim that technoscience is
compelling for its ability to create not only facts, but also
affectively charged temporized imaginaries. In these essays, I
differentiate between kinds of speculation, attending to the often
politically polyvalent work that dreaming futures does. More pointedly I
ask, how have girls and women been the objects of ongoing postcolonial
technoscientific speculative practices? Importantly, I do not mean
actual women and girls, but rather the *figure* of women and girls as a
figment of transnational social science, postcolonial development, and
speculative practices.

Over the second half of the twentieth century, a multitude of cold
war/postcolonial social science practices of development unfolded, each
obsessed with women and girls, each projecting potent phantasma for the
historian to notice. This thick globalized history of speculating about
the future within development summoned the abstracted figure of girls as
raced and gendered subjects in need of saving, enlightenment,
protection, or investment. Figures of girls and women, whose bodies were
the conduit to the future of the nation, often were the focus of
development social science practices that conjured possible better and
worse futures for decolonized places and brown bodies. Much of the
planet was plotted as under the threat of a population bomb contained in
the potential of women’s wombs, a bomb which could derail all other
development projects aimed at creating a more prosperous economic
modernity. Female bodies thus became a site that had to be calculated,
forecasted, and intervened in for the sake of a promissory future of
economic betterment, both for the individual and the nation. The
dreamscapes of cold war/postcolonial social science were thick with
female bodies and their future sexuality, fertility, rationality,
deviance, health, longevity, and productivity.

This series opens with one of the earliest examples of feminist science
fiction, “Sultana’s Dream.” It then turns to the demographic transition,
a model that helped to forecast the “population bomb,” followed by a
final meditation on the rise of financialized “invest in a girl”
campaigns at the end of the twentieth century. Together these shorts
essays aspire to provoke consideration of the potency of
technoscientific dreaming.

Sultana’s Dream
---------------

“Sultana’s Dream,” written in 1905, is celebrated as one of the earliest
examples of feminist science fiction. Its author, Begum Rokeya Shekhawat
Hossain, was a renowned advocate for Muslim women’s education and
equality in colonial India, born in 1880 in what is now Bangladesh.[^7]
Begum Rokeya was among the most prominent Bengali Muslim feminists of
the early twentieth century. At sixteen, she married the much older
Deputy Magistrate of Bhagalpur. As an elite Bengali Muslim woman, she
did not go to school and lived strict purdah (a religious and social
practice of secluding women and girls from non-kin men). With the
support of her brother who was undertaking a British style education,
Begum Rokeya cultivated her own education at home. Her husband died
young and with the money left to her she opened the first school for
Muslim girls in Calcutta, which still exists today. A prominent social
reformer, she also founded the Calcutta chapter of the
Anjuman-i-Khawatin-i-Islam, the primary women’s organization for Muslim
women in India. Writing in Bengali as well as English, she penned
numerous essays toward instigating the “awakening” of Muslim women. She
harshly condemned women’s restricted lives in purdah, as well as claims
of their spiritual and biological inferiority. In the portrait gallery
of Dhaka’s Pink Palace museum, Begum Rokeya is the single female face
dignifying the walls.

Begum Rokeya published “Sultana’s Dream” as a short English-language
story in *The Indian Ladies Magazine,* a publication for “modern” Indian
women. The story is narrated by an elite woman protagonist from her
luxurious secluded chambers. The protagonist falls asleep as she is
“thinking lazily of the condition of Indian womanhood.”[^8] She then
wakes into a dream.

Alert within her imaginary, she finds herself walking unveiled in
daylight in another world where the gendered structures of Indian Muslim
society are reversed: men are now confined to mardana (the name of the
outer part of a household for men and guests, in complement to zenana,
the inner part of a household reserved for women). In this world turned
upside down, women are unveiled in public, acting as the rulers and
scientists of this alternative way of being. “Lady” scientists have
turned away from building military machines and instead invent ways to
harness rain from the sky and share energy from the sun. One school of
women scientists “invented a wonderful balloon, to which they attached a
number of pipes. By means of this captive balloon which they managed to
keep afloat above the cloud-land, they could draw as much water from the
atmosphere as they pleased.” Another university “invented an instrument
by which they could collect as much sun-heat as they wanted. And they
kept the heat stored up to be distributed among others as required.”[^9]

Relishing her new public freedom, the protagonist learns the history
behind this fantastical otherworld. Not long ago, these scientific feats
were dismissed by the male-dominated military society as “sentimental
nightmares.” The revolution in gender roles, and the celebration of the
women’s science, had been achieved by a violent military victory. The
male-run military had failed to repel an invasion by another country
resulting in the tremendous loss of life. In a final bid to resist the
invasion, the exhausted men agreed to retire to seclusion at their homes
and turn the war over to the women. Female scientists then unleashed
their sun-heat on the enemy, burning them down, and winning dominion
over their country. Through this act of mass violence, a new society,
and scientific culture, was born.

The most distinguished science of this dream world was botany. The roads
were formed of a “soft carpet” of moss and flowers, and the city itself
was a marvelous garden.[^10] Sewing, too, was a celebrated art, and
beauty highly valued. In the garden, “\[e\]very creeper, every tomato
plant was itself an ornament,” such that the products of science were as
much aesthetic as functional, and science itself was not divorced from
feelings.[^11] “Sentimental” science, saturated with feeling and
kinship, was esteemed. This rearrangement of sentiment extended to
society itself. Here, all women were educated, and married late, while
men minded the children. Kinship was expanded such that “a distant
cousin is as sacred as a brother.”[^12] Thriving in a city built out of
the botanical and ecological feats of science, science itself expressed
new kinds of affective relations. In the end, the narrator abruptly
falls out of the dream to find herself back in her lounge chair, which
was also back in her own zenana.

Penned in a “real world” zenana, “Sultana’s Dream” summons an early
twentieth century feminist technoscience through a counterfactual world,
a world turned inside out. Awake to its projections, the story invites
oppressed women to dream *with* technoscience, social-relations, and
nature at a moment of agitation for access to formal education and South
Asian feminism. Yet, the story does not reverse all axes of inequality.
“Ladyland” is ruled by a Queen and the narrative leaves aristocracy and
class hierarchy in place as a benevolent form of rule. While the
inversion of men’s and women’s worlds reverses, rather than unravels,
binary gendered norms and compulsory heterosexuality, the text
influentially summons into apprehension the radical potential of another
way of doing technoscience, and the very possibility of contesting the
naturalization of the present. Begum Rokeya would herself become one of
the most revered women in the history of Bangladesh, and “Sultana’s
Dream” would become a celebrated inspiration for a different world right
into the present.

Written in a place and century when agricultural practices were being
rearranged by colonial regimes and capitalism, “Sultana’s Dream”
elevated botany, one of the few sciences gendered feminine and open to
amateur women, as the pivot for an alternative form of expert rule. In
this way, the story can be read as containing a decolonizing politics:
offering an uncolonized otherwise in which science becomes non-violent,
sustains life, and is endemic to women and South Asian culture. In
conjuring a phantasma of ecological, plant-centric science, Sultana’s
Dream presages the emergence of strong environmental and ecological
feminisms in South Asia, from the [Chipko
movement](http://www.apnauttarakhand.com/chipko-movement/) to the
internationally known ecofeminism of Vandana Shiva, or the ecological
farming movement of [Nayakrishi Andolon and the seed sharing work of
UBINI](http://www.ubinig.org/index.php/campaigndetails/showAerticle/6/13)G.
Through its figures of gardens, clouds and pleasure, “Sultana’s Dream”
suggests the possibility that subjects who dream with technoscience
might do life, gender, kinship, and nation differently.

One important way of reading this story is to celebrate the authorship
of an eminent Bengali Muslim woman writer, feminist, and social reformer
in the early twentieth century. Adding to this recognition, the text
might also be read as an invitation to think about the relationship
between technoscience, futurity, gender, and dreaming. Sultana’s Dream
can be situated along a genre of Western utopian writing that used the
trope of the dream as the entrance into conjuring another world.[^13]
More than this, in colonial Bengal, dreaming was charged with other
histories and forces. Dreams hold a special role in Islamic history and
in The Qu’ran.[^14] The Prophet Muhammed’s revelations included dreams
that were divinely inspired. Dream interpretation was an established
feature of medieval Muslim literature and practice, and a thick history
of dream interpretation exists in Bengal.[^15] Dreams can have a
prophetic potential, and offer divinely inspired insights and valued
knowledge. Such dream-visions can happen both when asleep and awake, as
waking visions. Importantly, they are understood to come to the dreamer
as opposed to being produced or authored by her. In the book *Dreams
that Matter,* about “dreaming in the undreamy time” of recent Egypt,
anthropologist Amira Mittermaier traces the history of Islamic dream
interpretation, warning against the all too frequent temptation of
Western scholarship to want to interpret the “unconscious” meaning of
dreams, and assign dreams to subjects. Mittermaier instead situates
Islamic dream interpretation in a long history of Islamic philosophical
and theological contemplation that ponders the difficulty of
distinguishing between wakefulness and dream, or between our thinking
and reality.[^16] The historian Projit Mukharji, writing about colonial
Bengal, draws out the importance of dreamscapes as potent intangibles
within South Asian traditional medical practices.[^17] Dreams, he has
argued, were a well of divine inspiration for innovative new treatments.
Dreams had epistemic authority that conferred divine force onto new
remedies or practices. Thus, dreams are not mere flights of fancy or
creations of the unconscious. They are a source of world-making that are
interacted with and bring potential, insight and innovation into the
world. Dreaming can be the perception of an intangible presence or
potential in a world saturated with intangibilities and held together by
imaginaries. The recognition of the powerful world making capacities of
nonsecular dreaming in Islamic and Bengali dream practice, pushes back
on Benjamin’s analysis of phantasmagoria to underline that technoscience
is as just one of many modalities of wakeful dreaming. Technoscientific
speculation, joins an already rich array of potent practices that
apprehend the immaterial and felt as a historical force.

Read through this history of potent dreaming, “Sultana’s Dream” hails
women and girls as aspirational and generative subjects of technoscience
and as crucial to the constitution of an anticipatory postcolonial
nation. Women become the agents and not just the objects of speculation.
Begum Rokeya described her social reform work as part of an “awakening”
of women. Sultana’s Dream “awakens” readers to an alternate possibility,
even though the narrator herself concludes by waking back into the
complexity of her luxurious oppression. Feminist technoscience is
affirmatively performed in the dream, and more than this, Sultana’s
Dream summons other futures through the speculative potential of
technoscience. Today, the story is still active as an inspiration
towards fashioning a future otherwise, a stimulus to [art
exhibits](http://www.sawcc.org/sultanas-dream/) and inspiring
[contemporary feminist ecological
practices](http://pwrdf.org/2006/recognizing-the-role-played-by-midwives-in-bangladesh-communities-1320683255/).
The text offers dreaming as a generative force that can affectively and
politically reorient the potentials in the world. In its narrative
construction, the story is very much awake to the force of that
dreaming. It is a speculative imaginary that works to unfix its 1905
present and summon other futures, even if improbable, for both women and
science.

What would it mean to be awake to the dream, to become alert to the
varieties of imaginative force and feeling that make up technoscience? I
want to take seriously the suggestion that technoscience is potent for
its ability to create not only facts, but also affectively charged
temporized imaginaries. Can one say that a characteristic of
technoscience is that it induces dreamscapes, in this instance,
nonsubjective imaginaries conjured by the practices of colonial science,
by the numbers of development indexes, by the tickertape of stock
markets, by the graphs of demography? What does it look like to let go
of the author function in our histories of speculation and speculative
fiction, and instead attend, like Benjamin, to the collective phantasma
that accompany the built and inhabited world?[^18] In this way, Begum
Rokeya did not just author “Sultana’s Dream” about technoscience, it was
at least partly animated by the rise of speculation about girls and
women that technoscience (then colonial, now postcolonial) helped to
create. The story dreams *with* *and through* (not just about)
technoscience.

Thus, we might see the speculative futurity in “Sultana’s Dream” as
doing more than subverting the figure of woman within the colonial
goalposts of modernity and tradition. “Sultana’s Dream,” perhaps,
participates affirmatively in a technoscientific project that figured
women and girls as contested postcolonial speculative subjects. It
signals the emergence of affectively charged speculative temporization
through which feminism, postcolonialism, development, capitalism, and
nationalism would all come to operate in the dreamscape of the twentieth
century.

Phantasmagrams of Population
============================

![](media/image2.jpg)

&lt;https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/1130/images/4513PH05.jpg&gt;

Imagine a desk-sized [IBM 1130](http://ibm1130.org/) computer in 1971.
There is no screen attached to the computer’s bulky body. Instead, above
the keyboard is a printer that spits out results intermittently. In
1971, this machine pulsated with the future. The computer is programmed
using FORTRAN with the [Carolina Population Center
Family](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/aboutcpc/history) Planning Administrator
Training Game that promises to train players in the arts of altering the
future of a national population. [^19]

The intended players are visiting civil servants involved in family
planning programs in their home country. In this role playing game, a
group of players are assigned roles as “decision makers” within a
hypothetical country and charged with overseeing a national family
planning effort. Players are prompted to allocate a finite amount of
funds towards different family planning project options. The players’
decisions are entered on programming cards that are fed into the
computer, and run through a simulation of the relationships between
population growth, “averting births,” death rate, literacy, family
planning demand, contraceptive supply, and income per capita, and other
variables. The computer then prints out the results as a tally of
“births averted” and “cost per averted birth,” and another round of play
begins.

The creators of the Family Planning Administrator Training Game were
upfront that their simulation inadequately captured the multitude of
uncertain and obscure relations that made up “population” and its
effects on “the economy.” Their game, however, was intended to imbue
players (assumed male in their literature) with a palpable sense of the
“interrelationships that link with uncertainty” making up
“population.”[^20] The game gave players a *feel* for population. “It is
not meant to be a facsimile of any society or governmental structure,”
the game designers explained, “It is to family planning what the game of
chess is to chivalry. One plays the game to gain experience in making
decisions in the face of uncertainty.”[^21] The game thus aspired to
conjure “population” as an aggregate form moving into the future replete
with correlations and uncertainties into player’s imaginaries.

For the game designers, developing countries were profoundly plagued by
“the irrational use of human reproductive powers.”[^22] Their game
contributed to the “urgent need for more systematic approaches” towards
the governing of population that was becoming a dominant goal within US
foreign policy. While family planning administrators were not expected
to understand the equations behind the simulation of population, it was
hoped that such training would imbue them with the sense of population
as a changeable constellation of relationships that could be
systematically steered towards desirable or dangerous futures,
especially by following US policy recommendations. The Family Planning
Administrators Training Game offered a pedagogy weighted with emotion,
but also an embodied sense of a massive phenomenon beyond calculative
apprehension.

This simulation game joined other computer simulations, demographic
models, five year plans, simple graphs, and other forms of
quantitatively summoning the future, all of which contributed to
miraculating “population” as a dense cloud of correlations that could be
felt and worried over. Population became a forceful intangible of cold
war/postcolonial governance. Population, I suggest, was a kind of
*phantasmagram*, an intangible form brought into sensibility as a
palpable presence with the help of quantitative practices.[^23] Models,
simulations, and forecasts are examples of speculative quantitative
practices that in the second half of the twentieth century propagated
popular imaginaries, lured feeling, and hence had supernatural effects
in surplus of their calculation.[^24]

The term phantasmagram points to the affectively charged and
extra-objective relations that are part of the speculative force of
numbers. In other words, it asks us to notice the ways calculative
speculations dream our world. Quantitative models do not merely
explicate population, they conjure a greater dissipated canopy of forces
whose conspicuous existence exceeds capacities to calculate. In the
second half of the twentieth century, “population” became a forceful
phantasmagram, a fulsome beyond of immaterial forces propelling
subjects, as well as subject not yet and perhaps never born, into
uncertain futures, some hopeful others apocalyptic.

The speculative future of population was invested with aspirations and
anxieties tied both to the promissory economic abundance of planned
intervention and to the threatening nightmares of planetary collapse.
While many social scientists factored in demand, approval, happiness,
and other psychological states of individuals in their explications of
population dynamics, the notion of the phantasmagrapm points to an
extra-subjective affective dimension to quantification practices.
Quantification helps to dream ineffable realms that can take shape as a
collectively felt form in excess of the representational and logical
limits of quantification practices themselves. One does not need to
understand the mathematical models behind population to join in the
feeling of being surrounded by a possible future of overpopulation.

Population in the twentieth century came to inhabit just such a
collective dreaming, helping people to feel dystopic or promissory
futures for themselves, their family, their nation, or the planet.
Beyond simulation and models, the mass dreaming of population as an
aggregate of relations stretching into the future was aided by national
and transnational infrastructures of data making – from censuses to
demographic and health surveys – as well as a visual vocabulary of
crowds, slums, and poverty. Population became a speculative aggregate
form that surrounded everyone, made of a throng of correlations
connected together as anticipatory trends in surfeit of what any
individual dreams or does alone. As an artifact of a technical
infrastructures and quantitative practices, population contributes to a
non-individual and non-conscious dreaming that substantiates the world
and is built back into government, institutions, and policy, into birth
control technologies, family planning programs, and clinics. Uncertain
and yet felt, it structures the world.

Undergirding “population” within the Family Planning Administrators
Training Game was one of the most influential phantasmagrams of the
second half of the twentieth century – the demographic transition. The
demographic transition was typically represented with a simple graph
that plotted birth rate, death rate, and population growth over time. It
plotted a set of shifts in birth and death rates that, according to an
influential signature study, had accompanied the historical progress of
Europe as it transformed from a “primitive” economy, to a
“pre-industrial” economy, and finally to a “modern industrial”
economy.[^25] This transition was elevated as an abstract model that
tied together economic futures and population futures.

Accordingly, in primitive economies, birth and death rates were both
high, leading to a steady population. In the pre-industrial economy, new
technologies and interventions lowered death rates, yet birth rates
remained the same, and hence the overall population grew rapidly. With
the arrival at a modern industrial economy, the birth rate would also
fall, leading back to a stable population. In the mid-twentieth century,
many demographers and social scientists in synchrony with US foreign
policy believed that post-colonial regions of the world were stuck in a
state of high population growth that would thwart their arrival at a
proper economic modernity.[^26]

In this influential yard stick of modernization, economic practices,
people, and regions were temporized as more or less forward or back in
time, and it was typically only at the modern horizon where new futures
began.[^27] Non-Western nations were largely categorized as existing in
a state of not yet having arrived at modernity. They were declared in a
temporal state of not-yet, of waiting to achieve the horizon where the
future starts.[^28] Economic development then became a “formative
speculative” project aimed at moving regions into universalized
industrial modernity. This temporal imaginary was given grammar and
number by the work of cold war/postcolonial social scientists, who
crafted the many measures and indexes that were correlated with the
passage into modernity: increased GDP per capita, birth rates, and
women’s social status were among the most enduring and potent of such
measures that were used to auger the chances of transitioning into
modernity.

Moreover, such measures often took women and girls as their objects of
speculative concern. In South Asia, older colonial logics had long
deployed the status of women as a sign of cultural barbarity, and thus
as a condition that legitimated colonial intervention.[^29] In the age
of postcolonial development, women’s status continued to signal the
temporal lag or promise of a racialized nation. Yet, in the first three
decades of globalized family planning, women and girls were largely—and
merely--abstractions of social science models.

From the 1960s through 1980s, US supported cold war/postcolonial social
science in particular plotted a global schema of uncertain modernization
in which the fecundity of racialized abstract female bodies threatened
to derail the future.[^30] As GDP became a universalized measure of the
performance of a nation’s “economy” at mid-century, and because
population size had a direct mathematical effect on the comparative
measure GDP per capita, the sense of the future hinging on averting
birth, and thus on the future life-making capacities of women’s bodies,
intensified.

How to arrive at the future of low birth rate, high GDP and industrial
modernity? While some social scientists believed birth rates would only
fall after economic development had been achieved, others, including the
influential social scientists at USAID’s Office of Population, believed
that preventing births was a necessary precursor to economic
development. Fertility, and thus the “irrational reproductive powers” of
women’s bodies endangered the future of economic progress. Thus, the
model of the demographic transition staged a new kind of postcolonial
futurity and speculative problem. How to intervene in the many clouds of
relations that directed the future of national “population” for the sake
of the future macroeconomy? How to prevent future life? How to avert
future birth?

National family planning programs around the planet were caught up in
this new speculative temporal orientation. The future was uncertain and
conjectural, and yet the present had to be altered for the sake of
possible futures. Women’s bodies themselves were conduits to these
different futures. Their possible fertility had to be preempted. In
South Asia and elsewhere (tracing a geography of US cold war
intervention), pilot projects, experimental field sites, and social
surveys proliferated from the 1960s through 1980s, all oriented towards
uncertain and aspirational crosshairs of averting future life. India,
Pakistan, and later Bangladesh, for example, all resided in the forecast
of a population bomb that demanded to be peremptorily defused, such that
the present could be declared in a state of emergency for the sake of a
possible apocalyptic future.

Through the phantasmagram of population, technoscience dreamed futures
through poor women’s figurative bodies, resulting in the concreteness of
sometimes coercive and violent family planning campaigns. Despite the
fact that academic demographers have vigorously debated the veracity of
the demographic transition model, it continues to travel as a potent
phantasmagram today, directing policies and undergirding the collective
imaginary of population. Poor, brown women’s bodies have been, and
continue to be, dense with speculation.

The Clock is Ticking
====================

&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e8xgF0JtVg&gt;

“We have a situation,” a 2010 promotional video for the Girl Effect
campaign informs us. The clock is ticking on the future life chances of
girls. What happens in girlhood will trigger two possible cascades of
correlation. In the dystopic cascade, she is married at 14, pregnant by
15, faced with sex work to support her family, which in turn puts her at
risk of “contracting and spreading” HIV. In the utopic cascade, she is
“happy and healthy” and stays in school, which allows her to escape sex
work and earn a leaving from her education, which in turn allows her to
“call the shots” so she can avoid HIV and choose when she marries and
has children. The utopic girl then passes on her good fortune to her
children, who then pass it on to future generations, thereby “impacting
the world.” Thus, girlhood offers an urgent window for pre-emption.

According to the promissory of the girl effect, the cascade of good
outcomes can be triggered by a well-timed “investment” in a girl. In the
[Girl Effect](http://www.girleffect.org/), life is temporized in terms
of risk pools, investment potentials, and rates of return. Thus, we can
distinguish the futurity as posited by modernization theory
(undergirding the demographic transition) with its sense of directing an
uncertain unfolding of historical time, from the futurity of
financialized speculation that seeks to stimulate or pre-empt particular
probabilities for the sake of a predicted payback.

At the turn of the millennium, the Girl Effect had spread to become a
dominant logic shaping transnational development.[^31] Merging financial
speculation with feminism, the Girl Effect was first put forward by the
[Nike Foundation in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIvmE4_KMNw)
as a new feminist form of development. It considers girls a kind of
human capital with the possibility of high rates of return, regularly
lauded as “the best investment in the developing world.”[^32] Investment
in a girl usually takes the form of primary school education. The idea
of Girl Effect builds on work from the 1990s by economists at the [World
Bank (led by Lawrence
Summers](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1992/05/01/000009265_3961003011714/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf))
who had calculated that educating girls reduced fertility for less cost
than directly funding family planning.

The returns on investing in girls are manifold: they accrue to the
future woman the girl will someday become, as well as her progeny, and
her nation-state. The returns come in the form of a cascade of good
effects, from her reduced fertility, to her increased future wages, and
her better health (and hence reduced drain on national resources), as
well as contributions to the well-being of her community, and increased
success as an entrepreneur. Future reduced fertility and increased
wages, moreover, have direct mathematical effects on the calculation of
GDP per capita, which is another kind of speculative benefit for the
nation-state as a whole. In the boosterism of Girl Effect promotions,
the cascade of good effects spreads to the entire globe, offering a way
out of our current economic and political “mess.”

The Girl Effect’s analysis of this chain of outcomes is based on a thick
archive of data produced by decades of social science family planning
and development research (including explicitly feminist work) about
girls.[^33] This archive of research offers a multitude of correlations
between girls’ fertility, labor, health, literacy, gender status, and so
on. This dispersed literature of correlation is gathered by the Girl
Effect and re-narrated as a single cascade that is then elevated an
abstract model making claims about girls in general and everywhere, and
not a statistical prediction about any given girl life. The girl effect
offers another example of a phantasmagram. Generated by the thick data
of postcolonial development, the Girl Effect dreams a speculative future
where all postcolonial poor girls have become sites of good investment
that can trigger a chain reaction with the potential to transform the
economy of the entire world.

The promissory of the Girl Effect is largely directed at Western donor
communities, policy makers, and transnational agencies. Its appeal is
partially that it offers a vision of “empowering girls” in synchrony
with the logics of speculative capital. Grounded development workers in
local NGOs are not so romantic about the possibility of easily
“unleashing change,” even if the resources that flow through the Girl
Effect, and its shifting of development priorities from reducing
fertility directly to encouraging education, are welcome.[^34]

Within development policy arenas, the Girl Effect is conjured using two
practices: quantification and animation. If the trust that animates
numbers is not a given, but needs to be generated, Girl Effect campaigns
have refined the art of mobilizing feeling with video, graphic design,
and music. Significantly, the Girl Effect has helped to crystalize a new
visual vocabulary for development promotions.[^35] Replacing realist
photos and film of suffering brown bodies, the Girl Effect is brought to
life through colorful animation, lively pie charts, [stop motion
filming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy7N2G_Hz_Y), [aestheticized
numbers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMErh8luzSE) and ebullient
music. Through energetic, if cartoonish, graphic design, the thick
archive of postcolonial data is re-presented as animated [charged data
points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaTfX2H7puc) that can be
[“unleashed”](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/video/2013/jul/15/maria-eitel-girl-effect-nike)
into a future of speculative prosperity. [The data and
statistics](https://vimeo.com/48163647) do not so much persuade as
provoke feelings, including feminist dreams of a better life for girls.

The excited videos with swelling musical scores can be hard to resist.
They attach to aspiration and fear, hope and anxiety for the future of
children, as well as a liberal political cosmology that extolls the idea
that a single individual can make a difference. This dream of a better
future that links poor children with the economic future of the planet,
can be triggered if the right investment is made now in the form of
micro-credit loans, electronic bank accounts accessed through cell
phones, or access to primary schooling. The chain reaction just waits to
be unleashed.

The Girl Effect has become a potent phantasmagram, spreading to
corporate responsibility campaigns of[
Walmart](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/29/how-walmart-reimagining-its-investments-empower-girls-and-women),
[Exxon](http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/community/womens-economic-opportunity/investing-in-women),
and
[Intel,](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/technology-in-education/smart-girls-smart-world-video.html)
shaping policy at the Gates Foundation, [the Clinton
Foundation,](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/authors/no-ceilings-full-participation-project)
the
[UN](http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/women-and-population/investing-adolescent-girls.html),
and even the office of the [US Secretary of
State](http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/girls/). It is embraced by
longstanding transnational NGOs like Plan and Care, as well as the
biggest NGO in the world, BRAC, based in Bangladesh. A 2008 [marketing
report by Goldman
Sachs](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/investing-in-women/bios-pdfs/women-half-sky-pdf.pdf)
echoes the findings of the World Bank and the Nike Foundation, reporting
that investing in educating girls has a “growth premium” that at a
macroeconomic level stimulates “higher productivity; higher

returns to investment; higher agricultural yields; and a more favorable
demographic structure.”[^36] Annotated with their standard
forward-looking disclosure statement in small font, the report hedges
its bets: “Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Future
returns are not guaranteed.”[^37] In speculative finance, the
opportunity for high returns comes with high risk. Poor girls are
extraordinarily risky subjects, and it is this intensity of
“under-invested” risk that speculative finance transmutes into
potential. This vision of girls as a well for speculative finance is
captured by Intel, in its Girl Rising campaign, which poses a young
beaming South American indigenous girl with a sign reading “I am the
emerging market.”

At the turn of the millennium, girls in sites as diverse as Peru,
Bangladesh, and Uganda have been gathered together by the Girl Effect as
agents of a new speculative future, part feminist, part finance. What
happens when the math does not add up? When girls are no longer the best
investment? Little is said in Girl Effect dreamscapes about the boys
that are brothers to these investable girls. Poor brown boys do not
often get aspirational speculative futures in this Western dreamscape of
uncertain futures. Instead, they are more likely to be mentioned
fearfully as sites of danger, [as incipient agents of
violence](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-smart-girls-vs-bombs.html?_r=0)
through the lens of foreign policy aimed at a war against the never
ending potential of[ future terrorism. ](http://m.state.gov/mc36630.htm)

Poor racialized girls living in postcolonial locals have perversely
become iconic figures of speculation on which elite technocratic dreams
of planetary economics, national development, and security have become
attached. The Girl Effect projects a potent mix of firmative and
affirmative speculation, where grassroots organizations, Western liberal
feminist imaginaries, and financial logics come together to dream forms
of investable and uninvestable life. Technoscience does dream futures.
Yet these dreams emanate from non-innocent infrastructures of social
science practice, acting as phantasma projected onto The Girl as if she
was the source of this dreaming.

Feminist science studies has long wrestled with the formative and
affirmative possibilities of technoscience, as can be seen in the work
of Donna Haraway, Alondra Nelson, and Karen Barad. The feminist science
studies scholar and biologist Banu Subramaniam brings affirmative
speculation into the domain of science in her book *Ghost Stories for
Darwin* in a way that echoes with the vision in *Sultana’s Dream*.
Discussing her research on plant variation in both India and the US ,
Subramaniam’s book includes the ghosts of past colonial, racist and
sexist violence as active agents in contemporary science, and even
further, includes dreams of a “futureworld of alternative science” for
South Asian girls doing science. Subramaniam argues that the task of an
aspirational science needs “fictional sciences” that have the capacity
of “imagining other configurations of knowledge making, reconstructing
alternative inter- and a-disciplinary lenses, new conceptual practices,
and more engaging plots and stories that are located in the
interdisciplinary fissues of the sciences and humanities.”[^38] Her book
gives further hope that it is possible to be awake in the dream. This
essay, too, has attempted to be awake to the dreamscapes of
technoscience. It suggests that attending to the history of phantasma
and the palablability of speculation is not only a necessary critical
task, but also a way to engage affirmatively with technoscience as it
conjures worlds with and through us.

Whether in the early twentieth century speculative fiction of Sultana’s
Dream, in the mid-century simulations of population control, or in the
21rst century phantasma of the investable girl, technoscience helps to
miraculate the dreamscapes of intangible phenomena that we inhabit. To
suggest that technoscience dreams is not meant to denigrate dreaming but
to recognize intangible imaginaries and our attachments to them as one
of technoscience’s most significant products. What would it look like to
be awake to the importance of intangibles enlivened by technoscience in
our everyday world? Technoscientific dreaming, while so often oriented
towards the speculative future, has had profound and concrete effects in
the present. And yet, it can be very difficult to awaken to the dream.
That is, it is difficult to awaken to the deeply contingent condition of
so many of the phenomena that have become the habitual surround of
political and technical life. It is difficult to awaken to more
affirmative dreams that might summon less violent, more open futures
with and not just about women and girls.[^39]

Technoscience often dreams firmatively. So often, the phantasma of
technoscience do not make the world strange, but rather help to confirm
the already given sense of the world. It recursively dreams the world it
makes sense in. While technoscience dreamscapes often shore up the
hegemonic experience of the world, they still hold the potential for
opening up alternative ways of being and knowing, feeling and attaching.
If we accept that technoscience dreams, how to affirmatively awaken to
these potentials not only in our futures, but in our pasts as well?

[^1]: From a historical perspective, there are many futures. That is,
    futurity, the epistemological and affective orientation towards the
    future, has multiple historical forms. In *Futures Past*, Reinhart
    Koselleck examines the relationships between past, present, and
    future in European thought.

    He argues that until the 18^th^ century, European Christian
    temporality was shaped by a sense of continuity and sameness: today
    is like tomorrow, because time has moved according to external
    forces only interrupted at the end times, when the world will end.
    In the 18^th^ century, a sense of historical time congealed, in
    which the past differs from and shapes the arriving future. Thus, in
    historical time, the past accumulates to explain the peculiarity of
    the present, while the future becomes a horizon of expectation
    progressing forward. In historical time, the present becomes a
    shifting ratio of marching modernity between what was and what will
    be next. While we might quibble with Koselleck’s Euro-centric
    typology of time, the important methodological point is that we can
    historicize futurity as a relational effect and trace the work of
    technoscience in generating particular ways of doing futurity. As
    historians, we can investigate varieties of “futurities” co-existing
    and intermingling, but still distinguishable from one another, in
    the twentieth century. Reinhart Koselleck, *Futures Past: On the
    Semantics of Historical Time*, trans. Keith Tribe (New York:
