	Histories of the Future—a conference held at Princeton University on February 6 and 7, 2015—considered the ways that science fiction and speculative nonfiction overlap to provide both scientists and popular audiences with visions of the future that are often surprising in their coherence.</p>

<div class="home_container middle">
<p>
  At the conference and in the essays on this site, we explore the intersection between professional and popular theorizing about the future of the cosmos, nature, and technology. Such futures, of course, linger at the edge of scientific respectability, and we have invited scholars who analyze a range of historical actors, from academically credible scientists, physicians, and engineers, to the authors of science fiction (and their occasional overlap).</p>

  Controversies over scientific ideas, from evolution to climate change, have been contentious as much for their (implied and explicit) futures as for their pasts. We re-excavate the history of the sciences by attending to these varied constructions of humanity’s destiny, from the seventeenth century to the early twenty-first.</p>
